## Use CSS Grid to Create a Webpage Layout

In this assignment, I implemented CSS Grid, an advanced layout system within CSS, to create an e-commerce webpage.

One of the main benefits of CSS Grid over other layout systems such as Flexbox is its ability to layout items in two dimensions (rows and columns) simultaneously.
